Description: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique to
    study gene expression, cellular heterogeneity, and cell states within
    samples in single-cell level. The development of scRNA-seq shed light to
    address the knowledge gap about the cell types, cell interactions, and key
    genes involved in biological process and their dynamics. To precisely meet
    the publishing requirement, reduce the time of communication the
    bioinformatician with researchers, and increase the re-usability and
    reproducibility of scientific findings, based on ShinyCell, the scRNAseqApp
    package is developed with multiple highly interactive visualizations of how
    cells and subsets of cells cluster behavior for scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and
    sc-multiomics data. The end users can discover the expression of genes in
    multiple interactive manners with highly customized filter conditions by
    selecting metadata supplied with the publications and download the
    ready-to-use results for republishing. This package served as the demo for
    application of scRNAseqApp.
